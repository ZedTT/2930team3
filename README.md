# ReStyle

Deployed website URL: [http://restyle-0510.azurewebsites.net/](http://restyle-0510.azurewebsites.net/)

Our web application, ReStyle allows users to easily trade clothes with other users. It promotes sharing and reusing of clothes that otherwise would be disposed. Just by using the app for swapping users are unconsciously helping the environment.

Our application solves the problem that arises when people wish to refresh their wardrobe, without purchasing new items of clothing. For fashion lovers who like to update their closet on a consistent basis but want to minimize their environmental impact and save money, our app will be provide a great solution.

  - Angular is based on TypeScript language. 
  - We also wrote our node server in TypeScript. 

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

- JavaScript

## Hosting

- [Azure Web Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/cloud-services/search/?&OCID=AID719803_SEM_zBVKwwIG&lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&dclid=CjgKEAjww47nBRC_7umJ2YDDvHMSJADGx9nAxdf-mA1TAZfRV5eIgm5Az3g1YU_MxFFW81_Z00o5b_D_BwE)
  - We deployed our app on Azure.
  - PostgreSQL server is also deployed on Azure.



## Build

- There is a dbKey.ts / .js file that encapsulates a key to get data from the Azure database. You need to ask developers to get the file.



### Install dependencies

We recommend you install [npm-install-missing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-install-missing) module from node package manager for installing dependencies. In order to use the command `npm-install-missing`, you have to install "npm-install-missing" module globally. This can be done from the command line.

```shell
$ npm install --global npm-install-missing
```

If you encounter authorization problems in macOS, you can use sudo command.

```shell
$ sudo npm install --global npm-install-missing
```



We have both "ReStyle-Frontend" and "ReStyle-Backend" directories and you will need to install all the dependencies for both of the directories seperately. 

##### Back-end 

```shell
$ cd /ReStyle-Backend
$ npm-install-missing
```

##### Front-end

```shell
$ cd ../ReStyle-Frontend
$ npm-install-missing
```



### Run the server using node

Finally, you can consecutively build front-end and back-end, and start the server!

##### Terminal / Command Prompt

```shell
$ npm run startall
```

The `startall` script is written in `package.json` file for convenience.
